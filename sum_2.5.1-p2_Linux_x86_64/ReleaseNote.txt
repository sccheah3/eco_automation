Supermicro Update Manager (SUM) Release Notes
================================================
Software Release Version: V2.5.1-p2
Release Date: 2021/01/15


Introduction
============
The Supermicro Update Manager (SUM) can be used to manage the BIOS/BMC/CMM/PSU/
Broadcom 3108 RAID firmware image update and configuration update for select
systems. In addition, system checks as well as event log management are also
supported.
Moreover, special applications are also provided to facilitate system
management. To update configurations, users can edit system BIOS settings, DMI
information and BMC/RAID/CMM configurations from readable text files, as well as
use this update manager to apply these configurations.

Two channels are possible for management: the OOB (Out-Of-Band) channel, i.e.
communication through the BMC IPMI interface, and the in-band channel, i.e.
communication through the local system interfaces. By the OOB channel, most
management commands (except CheckSystemUtilization) can be executed
independently of the OS on the managed system and even before the system OS
is installed.
